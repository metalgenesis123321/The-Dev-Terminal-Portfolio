### About
```
> run ./about_me.sh
Hi there — I’m a developer who believes that *code should feel alive*.

I love building interfaces that don’t just function — they **interact**, **respond , and **surprise**.
My portfolio is a playground for creativity disguised as a terminal.

Because who said personal sites have to be boring?
